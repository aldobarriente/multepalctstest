# Multepal CTS Test
A CTS-compliant edition test for the Multepal project

This repo is largely based on the capitains guidelines repo at https://github.com/Capitains/guidelines

The urns and directory structures are still under development. 

The current test only applies to the second paragraph of both the K'iche' and Spanish.
